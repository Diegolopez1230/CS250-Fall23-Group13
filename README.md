# CS250-Fall23-Group13

Four ground rules that you believe will benefit your group and help you function better (i.e. giving each person a chance to speak whenever making decisions and assigning a member who is in charge of making sure that happens, updating everyone twice weekly via email or phone, etc.)
  Great communication on discord
  Speak up and holding each other accountable
  Meeting up or call 
  Looking over everyone work
Three things that you have experienced in groups that you DON’T want to happen; along with how you think it can be prevented.
  One person does everything - ties into communication 
  Waiting till the last minute - act as if the deadline is sooner
  Going silent
Finish this sentence… “I function best in groups when…” everyone understands the task at hand and we go about it effectively. 
Finish this sentence… “I really hope our group can…” get 100s on the assignments
